## Known Issues - FIXED

The following issues were identified and fixed in `App.tsx`:

### 1. Memory Leak in Fallback Timeout

**Problem**: The 10-second fallback timeout was never cleared when the operation completed early.
**Fix**: Added `batchTimeoutRef` to store timeout ID, cleared in `clearBatchOperationState()` helper and on component unmount.
**Lines**: 68-69, 192-202, 487-491

### 2. Race Condition - Exit Selection Mode During Processing

**Problem**: User could exit selection mode while a batch operation was still processing.
**Fix**: Added guard in `toggleSelectionMode()` to prevent exiting when `batchProcessing` is true.
**Lines**: 158-162

### 3. Stale Selections After Approvals Refresh

**Problem**: Selected IDs could reference approvals that no longer exist after data refresh.
**Fix**: Added validation in `approvals-updated` handler to filter out invalid selection IDs.
**Lines**: 380-392

### 4. Double-Submission on Rapid Clicks

**Problem**: Rapidly clicking batch action buttons could trigger multiple operations.
**Fix**: Added guard in `startBatchOperation()` to check both `batchProcessing` state and `pendingBatchOperation` ref.
**Lines**: 209-212

### Verification Tests

- [ ] Verify timeout is cleared when operation completes before 10 seconds
- [ ] Verify "Cancel" button is disabled/ignored during batch processing
- [ ] Verify stale selections are removed when approvals refresh
- [ ] Verify rapid double-clicks only trigger one operation
